## Exploring new technology options: OpenAPI and JSON

The support for JSON and OpenAPI which is now built into the DATEX II tool set,

then in pairs or small groups we will generate code on our computers. We will look inside the JSON schemas generated by the DATEX II schema wizard, to see the kinds of constructs produced. We will take the JSON schema content and add further information to produce the definition of an API, using OpenAPI. You will then generate code that can be used in a service. We will cover Java and C#, depending on participantsâ€™ experience. If possible, please bring your computer with a git-hub account that is not prevented from using codespaces by enterprise policies.
